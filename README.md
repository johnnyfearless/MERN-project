## Overview

This MERN application prompts a user to enter their information to win a trip to Iceland, and the information is stored in a MongoDB database.

## Features

- **ReactJS**: React is the library for web and native user interfaces. Build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components written in JavaScript.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents, rather than traditional rows and tables. .
